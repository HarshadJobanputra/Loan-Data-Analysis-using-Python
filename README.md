**Objective:**
  This Project aims to analyse the data and get KPI insights from the banking data using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly.express).

**About the Project:**
- In order to monitor and assess the bank's lending activities and performance, create a comprehensive Bank Loan Analysis using Python. 
- The analysis will help make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

- KPIs included for analysis
  **Total Loan Applications:** Total number of loan applications received during a specified period.
  **Total Funded Amount:** Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial.
  **Total Amount Received:** Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment.
  **Average Interest Rate:** Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, which will provide insights into the lending portfolio's overall cost.
  **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health

  **Good Loan:** Amount received from the customers and the customer repaying the loan amount on a regular basis. 
    **KPIs:** Good Loan Application Percentage, Applications, Funded Amount, Total Received Amount.
  **Bad Loan:**
    **KPIs:**  Bad Loan Application Percentage, Applications, Funded Amount, Total Received Amount.

  **Chart and Graphs for analysis in Python:**
    -   Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line/ Area Chart):  To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.
    -   Regional Analysis by State (Bar Chart): To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities.
    -   Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
    -   Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.
    -   Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.
    -   Home Ownership Analysis (Tree/ Heat Map): For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
 
  **Learning:**
    Python libraries:
    - **Pandas**: Cleaning, reporting, and importing data
    - **NumPy**: Numerical calculation
    - **Matplotlib**: For Basic charts and graphs (2-dimensional)
    - **Seaborn**: advanced plotting and charts (e.g., Heatmap, Treemap)
    - **plotly.express**: interactive advanced chart (e.g., Scatter plot, area chart)
  
    - Data cleaning, analysis and calculations to calculate KPIs.
